**Q. Can I use basis?**

A. Not yet, but please contact us if you're interested

**Q. How much will basis cost?**

A. The framework will be free. The deterministic replay component will not be. No public pricing yet. The general goal is for hobbyists, schools, and pre-funding companies to pay nothing. Any component we charge for will be useful for production robots and scaling codebases, and not vital if you're only at the prototyping stage. I'd love to release the replay component for free, also, but something has to pay for development.

**Q. What will basis's source license be?**

A. The core framework's best candidate is MIT, but [FSL](https://fsl.software) is really cool. One of our goals it to make it easy to fork and improve. The deterministic replayer and other paid components will likely always be closed source (source available?).

**Q. Can you demo this to us?**

A. We'd love to demo. Hit us up over email.

**Q. Does determinisitic replay work for simulation?**

A. Yes - with a bit more work. If you're a basis user, we will work with you to integrate your simulator.

**Q. Can I contribute?**

A. Not right now. Once we release source...maybe. The best place for external contributors will be for things like sensor drivers and other modules that can be pulled in.

**Q. Can I sponsor or fund Basis?**

A. We're currently looking for funding (in the VC sense). We're open to other ideas (sponsorship, bootstrapping, etc). Please shoot us an email.
